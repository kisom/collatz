## collatz

A semi-arbitrary computation problem comparing the performance of
several languages. The program calculates the number of Collatz chains
with a length over a certain bound. The program iterates from [1...n],
where n is some maximum starting number.

Results on my Thinkpad:

* Haskell (interpreted): 12.00 seconds, 4.1 GiB allocated
* Haskell (compiled): 1.86 seconds, 121 KiB allocated
* Go: 35 milliseconds, 151 KiB allocated
* Common Lisp: 900 milliseconds, 178 MiB consed (which doesn't speak
  to the actual memory usage, just bytes consed)
* C: 17 milliseconds, no heap allocated
* node.js: 93 milliseconds, 3.9 MiB heap total

from the Ubuntu repositories):
